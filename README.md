TITLE : // <H1>"BIGGEST HEADER</H1>

<!-- Overview: a summary of the project, including why you picked the game you picked to build --> WORD GUESS -- 
I PICKED THIS GAME BEFORE I EVEN KNEW IT WAS A OPTION. I GUESS THIS IS A HIGHLY FAVORED GAME FOR THOSE WHO LIKE TO PLAY GAMES WITH WORDS.

Concept of the game is to guess the word.

So there will be 3 hints on the side. ( FOR EACH ROUND )

And you have to guess what the word is based on the Hints. 
You Get 3 tries OR UNTIL TIME LIMIT RUN OUT to guess the correct word on each round. 

PLAYER 1 GOES FIRST TO ENTER WORD --------- THEN PLAYER TWO.

 WHO EVER PICK TO BE PLAYER ONE WILL BE THE ONE TO GO FIRST TO TRY. 

 EACH ROUND THERE ARE 3 HINTS THAT IS GIVEN. 

 TIME LIMIT - WHEN TIME IS UP - IT WILL AUTOMATTICALLY SWITCH TO PLAYER TWO.

 (EXAMPLE): 
1ST HINT: YOU CAN FIND THIS IN A HOUSE, A RESTURANT AND STREET.
2: YOU USE IT EVERYDAY.
3:IT HELPS YOU FIND THINGS IF NEEDED.
